# Data-Structures_HashKeyDictionary
In this Python project, a hash table-based dictionary is created. Users can create a new dictionary entry at an index of their choosing, whether the index is an integer, string, float, etc. A collision avoidance strategy is implemented to avoid multiple keys mapping to the same entry. This code allows for the insertion and retrieval of dictionary entries, as well as printing the dictionary in alphabetized and/or chronological order. See .docx file for greater project details
